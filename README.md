## Issues of Food Production in Connection to Globalisation

Globalisation has a profound impact on food production, bringing both opportunities and challenges. Below are the key issues, supported by scientific evidence, presented in keywords:

- **Industrial Agriculture**: Globalisation promotes large-scale industrial agriculture, which can lead to monocultures and reduced biodiversity.
- **Supply Chains**: Global supply chains increase the distance food travels, contributing to higher carbon footprints.
- **Food Security**: Globalisation can both enhance and threaten food security; while it increases food availability, it also makes local markets vulnerable to global price fluctuations.
- **Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)**: The spread of GMOs through global trade raises concerns about biodiversity and long-term health impacts.
- **Land Use Change**: Expansion of agricultural land due to global demand leads to deforestation and habitat loss.
- **Water Resources**: Intensive farming practices driven by global markets strain water resources, leading to depletion and pollution.
- **Labor Exploitation**: Global food production often relies on cheap labor, leading to exploitation and poor working conditions.
- **Cultural Erosion**: Globalisation can lead to the loss of traditional farming practices and local food cultures.
- **Food Miles**: The concept of "food miles" highlights the environmental impact of transporting food over long distances.
- **Sustainability**: Globalisation challenges the sustainability of food systems by prioritizing efficiency and profit over ecological balance.
- **Climate Change**: Industrial agriculture contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change.
- **Nutritional Quality**: The globalisation of food systems can lead to the spread of processed and nutrient-poor foods, impacting public health.
- **Trade Policies**: International trade policies can affect local farmers' ability to compete, leading to economic instability in rural areas.
- **Food Waste**: Global supply chains contribute to significant food waste due to inefficiencies and overproduction.

## Food Inc. Movie

**"Food Inc."** is a documentary film released in 2008 directed by Robert Kenner. The movie explores the industrialization of food production and its impact on health, the environment, and the economy.

The film focuses on the meat industry and shows how globalization has affected it. 

- Globalization has led to the consolidation of the meat industry, with a few corporations controlling the majority of the market. This has led to decreased competition, higher prices, and lower quality meat.
- Industrial meat production has led to the widespread use of antibiotics, which has increased the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This poses a threat to human health.
- The film also highlights the working conditions of meatpacking workers, who are often low-wage immigrant workers subjected to dangerous working conditions.
- The use of genetically modified crops and monoculture farming practices has led to a loss of biodiversity and soil degradation.
- The film also shows how government policies favor large agribusinesses over small farmers, making it difficult for small-scale farmers to compete in the market.

# Water pollution and scarcity

Water scarcity and water pollution are two critical issues that affect people and the environment worldwide. Both of these issues have a significant impact on our daily lives, our health, and the health of ecosystems.

## Water scarcity

![youtube-video](media/live/ijrhhzx-jmk.jpeg "click to load video"){#ijRhHZx_JMk .youtube}

Water scarcity is the lack of sufficient water resources to meet the demands of a population or region. This can occur due to a variety of factors, including climate change, population growth, and inefficient use of water resources. Water scarcity can lead to food insecurity, public health issues, and social unrest.

One example of water scarcity can be seen in the Middle East, particularly in the Arabian Peninsula, which is one of the most water-scarce regions in the world. Saudi Arabia, for instance, has limited freshwater resources and relies heavily on desalination to meet its water needs. The country's capital, Riyadh, is one of the most water-stressed cities in the world, with severe water shortages during the summer months.

## Water pollution

![](media/live/naja-bertolt-jensen-2st3s36gu7w-unsplash.jpeg)

Water pollution, on the other hand, refers to the contamination of water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and oceans with substances that can harm human health and the environment. Water pollution can occur due to industrial activities, agricultural practices, and inadequate sewage treatment.

An example of water pollution can be seen in the Ganges River in India, which is one of the most polluted rivers in the world. The river is heavily contaminated with industrial waste, sewage, and agricultural runoff, which has led to numerous health problems for the millions of people who rely on it for drinking water and irrigation. The city of Kanpur, located along the banks of the Ganges, is a major industrial hub and a significant contributor to the river's pollution.

# E-Waste

![youtube-video](media/live/jxdrivshzku.jpeg "click to load video"){#JXDrIvShZKU .youtube}

## Electronic waste

Electronic waste, also known as e-waste, refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, televisions, and refrigerators. The improper disposal of e-waste can have severe environmental and health consequences, especially in third-world countries where the infrastructure for e-waste management is inadequate.

One of the significant problems associated with e-waste is the release of toxic chemicals into the environment, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. These chemicals can contaminate the soil, water, and air, leading to health problems such as cancer, birth defects, and neurological damage.

In many third-world countries, e-waste is often shipped illegally from developed countries and dumped in landfills or burned in open-air pits, releasing toxic fumes and polluting the environment. Workers in these areas, including children, often work without proper protective gear, exposing themselves to harmful chemicals and suffering from respiratory problems and other health issues.

## Abgogbloshie

One real-world example of the impact of e-waste can be seen in the Agbogbloshie landfill in Accra, Ghana. Agbogbloshie is one of the largest e-waste dumpsites in the world and receives thousands of tons of e-waste every year. The area has become a major health hazard for the people living and working there, and studies have shown that the toxic chemicals from the e-waste have contaminated the soil, air, and water.

# Climate change

[TOC]

## Deforestation

![youtube-video](media/live/b5fwl4p4ew8.jpeg "click to load video"){#B5Fwl4P4EW8 .youtube}

Deforestation refers to the permanent destruction of forests or wooded areas, primarily caused by human activities such as logging, agriculture, and urbanization. Deforestation can have severe environmental consequences and impact the planet's biodiversity, climate, and local communities.

Forests play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Deforestation releases this stored carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change.

In addition, forests provide habitats for countless plant and animal species, many of which are endemic to certain regions. Deforestation can lead to the extinction of these species and disrupt entire ecosystems, impacting the natural balance of the environment.

Deforestation also has significant social impacts. Many communities around the world rely on forests for their livelihoods, either through subsistence agriculture or by selling forest products such as timber and non-timber forest products. Deforestation can threaten the economic and cultural well-being of these communities.

One real-world example of the impact of deforestation can be seen in the Amazon rainforest in South America. The Amazon is the world's largest tropical rainforest and is home to millions of species of plants and animals. However, deforestation has led to the destruction of large areas of the rainforest, primarily for agriculture and cattle ranching. This has not only threatened the biodiversity of the region but has also contributed to climate change by releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
