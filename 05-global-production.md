# Global Production

[TOC]

> Global production refers to the process of creating goods and services across multiple countries, often involving the collaboration of various companies and organizations from different parts of the world. It is a complex system that involves the movement of resources, capital, and labor across borders, and has significant implications for both the global economy and local markets.

## Outsourcing and Offshoring

Outsourcing refers to the practice of contracting out work to external companies or individuals, often in other countries, in order to reduce costs or gain access to specialized skills or resources. Offshoring refers specifically to the practice of moving production or services to a foreign country.

Example: Nike, Inc. is a sportswear company that outsources the production of its shoes to factories in countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia, where labor costs are lower than in the United States.

## Supply Chain Management

Supply chain management refers to the coordination of activities involved in the production and distribution of goods and services, from the sourcing of raw materials to the delivery of finished products. TNCs often have complex supply chains that span multiple countries and involve multiple suppliers and partners.

Example: The fast food chain McDonald's Corporation sources its ingredients from a wide range of suppliers around the world, including beef from Australia, potatoes from the United States, and coffee from Colombia.

## Impact on Local Markets

The global production system has both positive and negative impacts on local markets. TNCs can bring investment, technology, and jobs to local communities, but they can also compete with local businesses, exploit workers, and harm the environment.

Example: The garment industry in Bangladesh has experienced rapid growth due to outsourcing by TNCs such as H&M and Zara. While this has created jobs and boosted the economy, it has also been criticized for low wages, poor working conditions, and safety concerns following the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013.

## The Rise of Transnational Companies

Transnational companies (TNCs) are large corporations that operate in multiple countries, often with headquarters in one country and subsidiaries in others. They have become increasingly important players in global production, and have a significant impact on local markets.

Example: Apple Inc. is a transnational company that designs, manufactures, and sells consumer electronics, software, and online services. It has production facilities in China, Taiwan, and other countries, and sells its products in markets around the world.

Global production is a complex and multifaceted system that involves the collaboration of companies and organizations from around the world. Transnational companies play a major role in this system, with significant implications for both the global economy and local markets. It is important to consider the positive and negative impacts of global production, and work towards creating a more sustainable and equitable system for all.
