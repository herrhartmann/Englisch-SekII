## Issues of Food Production in Connection to Globalisation

Globalisation has a profound impact on food production, bringing both opportunities and challenges. Below are the key issues, supported by scientific evidence, presented in keywords:

- **Industrial Agriculture**: Globalisation promotes large-scale industrial agriculture, which can lead to monocultures and reduced biodiversity.
- **Supply Chains**: Global supply chains increase the distance food travels, contributing to higher carbon footprints.
- **Food Security**: Globalisation can both enhance and threaten food security; while it increases food availability, it also makes local markets vulnerable to global price fluctuations.
- **Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)**: The spread of GMOs through global trade raises concerns about biodiversity and long-term health impacts.
- **Land Use Change**: Expansion of agricultural land due to global demand leads to deforestation and habitat loss.
- **Water Resources**: Intensive farming practices driven by global markets strain water resources, leading to depletion and pollution.
- **Labor Exploitation**: Global food production often relies on cheap labor, leading to exploitation and poor working conditions.
- **Cultural Erosion**: Globalisation can lead to the loss of traditional farming practices and local food cultures.
- **Food Miles**: The concept of "food miles" highlights the environmental impact of transporting food over long distances.
- **Sustainability**: Globalisation challenges the sustainability of food systems by prioritizing efficiency and profit over ecological balance.
- **Climate Change**: Industrial agriculture contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change.
- **Nutritional Quality**: The globalisation of food systems can lead to the spread of processed and nutrient-poor foods, impacting public health.
- **Trade Policies**: International trade policies can affect local farmers' ability to compete, leading to economic instability in rural areas.
- **Food Waste**: Global supply chains contribute to significant food waste due to inefficiencies and overproduction.

## Food Inc. Movie

**"Food Inc."** is a documentary film released in 2008 directed by Robert Kenner. The movie explores the industrialization of food production and its impact on health, the environment, and the economy.

The film focuses on the meat industry and shows how globalization has affected it. 

- Globalization has led to the consolidation of the meat industry, with a few corporations controlling the majority of the market. This has led to decreased competition, higher prices, and lower quality meat.
- Industrial meat production has led to the widespread use of antibiotics, which has increased the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This poses a threat to human health.
- The film also highlights the working conditions of meatpacking workers, who are often low-wage immigrant workers subjected to dangerous working conditions.
- The use of genetically modified crops and monoculture farming practices has led to a loss of biodiversity and soil degradation.
- The film also shows how government policies favor large agribusinesses over small farmers, making it difficult for small-scale farmers to compete in the market.

In the end, the film presents alternatives to industrial food production, such as supporting small-scale and sustainable agriculture, buying locally-grown produce, and reducing meat consumption. The movie also encourages viewers to advocate for better food policies and support organizations that promote sustainable agriculture.
