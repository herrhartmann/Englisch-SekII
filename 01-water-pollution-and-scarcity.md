# Water pollution and scarcity

[TOC]

Water scarcity and water pollution are two critical issues that affect people and the environment worldwide. Both of these issues have a significant impact on our daily lives, our health, and the health of ecosystems.

## Water scarcity

Water scarcity is the lack of sufficient water resources to meet the demands of a population or region. This can occur due to a variety of factors, including climate change, population growth, and inefficient use of water resources. Water scarcity can lead to food insecurity, public health issues, and social unrest.

One example of water scarcity can be seen in the Middle East, particularly in the Arabian Peninsula, which is one of the most water-scarce regions in the world. Saudi Arabia, for instance, has limited freshwater resources and relies heavily on desalination to meet its water needs. The country's capital, Riyadh, is one of the most water-stressed cities in the world, with severe water shortages during the summer months.

## Water pollution

Water pollution, on the other hand, refers to the contamination of water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and oceans with substances that can harm human health and the environment. Water pollution can occur due to industrial activities, agricultural practices, and inadequate sewage treatment.

An example of water pollution can be seen in the Ganges River in India, which is one of the most polluted rivers in the world. The river is heavily contaminated with industrial waste, sewage, and agricultural runoff, which has led to numerous health problems for the millions of people who rely on it for drinking water and irrigation. The city of Kanpur, located along the banks of the Ganges, is a major industrial hub and a significant contributor to the river's pollution.
