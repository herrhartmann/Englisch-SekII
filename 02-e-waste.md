## Electronic waste

Electronic waste, also known as e-waste, refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, televisions, and refrigerators. The improper disposal of e-waste can have severe environmental and health consequences, especially in third-world countries where the infrastructure for e-waste management is inadequate.

One of the significant problems associated with e-waste is the release of toxic chemicals into the environment, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. These chemicals can contaminate the soil, water, and air, leading to health problems such as cancer, birth defects, and neurological damage.

In many third-world countries, e-waste is often shipped illegally from developed countries and dumped in landfills or burned in open-air pits, releasing toxic fumes and polluting the environment. Workers in these areas, including children, often work without proper protective gear, exposing themselves to harmful chemicals and suffering from respiratory problems and other health issues.

## Abgogbloshie

One real-world example of the impact of e-waste can be seen in the Agbogbloshie landfill in Accra, Ghana. Agbogbloshie is one of the largest e-waste dumpsites in the world and receives thousands of tons of e-waste every year. The area has become a major health hazard for the people living and working there, and studies have shown that the toxic chemicals from the e-waste have contaminated the soil, air, and water.
